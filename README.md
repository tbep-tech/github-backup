This repository is used to create an archive of all repositories in the tbep-tech GitHub organization page.  Each repository is archived as a .tar.gz file and then uploaded to Amazon S3 services on a weekly basis.  Motivation for this workflow was created from an rOpenSci blog post on [2022/3/22](https://ropensci.org/blog/2022/03/22/safeguards-and-backups-for-github-organizations/).  Click the archive badge above to see the archive log.
