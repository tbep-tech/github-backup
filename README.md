This repository is used to create an archive of all repositories in the tbep-tech GitHub organization page and upload to Amazon S3 services on a weekly basis.  Motivation for this workflow was created from an rOpenSci blog post on [2022/3/22](https://ropensci.org/blog/2022/03/22/safeguards-and-backups-for-github-organizations/).
